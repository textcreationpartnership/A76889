            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHere Lu≈øt takes up our de≈øires, and Revenge and Murther ≈øeizeth on our re≈øolutions, it is the true way to make us wretched in this life, and our ≈øouls mi≈øerable in that to come; For if Cha≈øtity and Charity, (the two precious vertues and Ornaments of a Chri≈øtian) ≈øteer not our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Earth; how ≈øhall, nay, how can he arrive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171920:3"/>to the Harbour of Heaven; or if we abandon tho≈øe cele≈øtial vertues to follow and imbrace tho≈øe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal vices, what do we but take our ≈øelves from felicity to mi≈øery, and con≈øequently give our ≈øelves from God to Satan; but did we ≈øeriou≈øly (and truly) con≈øider that there is a Heaven ro Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Righteous; and a Hell to puni≈øh the ungodly? We would neither defile our hearts, and polute our ≈øouls with the thoughts, much le≈øs with the actions of ≈øuch bea≈øtly and inhumane crimes: but in this ≈øinful age of ours, there is two many la≈øcivious nd invious wretches, who make it their bu≈øine≈øs to debauch them≈øelves and others. Among whom I here repre≈øent unto you a ≈øad, but true Hi≈øtory: <hi>(It's Bloody, and therefore mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)</hi> But if we dere≈øt the crime, we need not fear the puni≈øhment, for God is as gracious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to protect the innocent, as Ju≈øt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to ch≈øti≈øe the guilty.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Chattam</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> lately Lived one ‚Äî <hi>Ruttle,</hi> a la≈øcivious debaucht Young-man, being much adicted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keeping, having thereby wa≈øted almo≈øt all his portion; begins to take into con≈øideration how he might rai≈øe his fortune, and redeem his credit: Fir≈øt, reforms his life; and having put on a civil garb, and Nature haveing endewed him with wit and comline≈øs, he re≈øolves to ≈øeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Yoke-fellow, and ≈øuch a one as might help him in this low e≈øtate which he had brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf into. He informs his friends of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171920:3"/>to marty; Who inform'd him of a Per≈øon living near him, that had they were ≈øure enough to ≈øupply his pre≈øent occa≈øions, (and would no doubt if he plea≈øed to make his mind known unto her) be willing to accept of him. He having this incouragement re≈øolves to give this per≈øon a vi≈øit, and that upon the next day, which he thought long e're it came; Now the Morning being ceme he puts his re≈øolution into practice; Being come into her pre≈øence, and having fixt his eye upon her, ≈øaw ≈øhe was worthy to be beloved, and proceeds to make his mind known unto her, and ≈øeek her for his Wife, by his own ≈øolicitations, promi≈øes, attain'd her good will to marry her, but not without ≈øighs, rears, and Prayers, and Oaths; and by the≈øe fal≈øe hypocritical tears and promi≈øes he gets the good will of this poor Widdow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mother of two Children, and them both living, the one at Nur≈øe, the other at home with her about ≈øix or ≈øeven years old; and now having got her good will for which he came, he doth proceed to confirm the bu≈øine≈øs, and that by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her what ≈øhe de≈øired to know, viz. What he had, and in what way he was to live, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to maintain ≈øhe and her two Children in ca≈øe ≈øhe ≈øhould grant him her good will: He knowing that he could not if he ≈øooke the truth give her full ≈øatisfaction; therefore as he now ≈øaith, he re≈øolved to turn the be≈øt ≈øide outwards, and to tell her that he had a con≈øiderable living neer <hi>Canterbury</hi> which was morgaged, but if ≈øhe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171920:4"/>had but ≈øo much money that would redeem it, then it would be worth ≈øo much a year, and that would be enough to maintain them, and if ≈øhe had not ≈øo much, he did not doubt but he could borrow ≈øo much, and if ≈øhe plea≈øed but to go along with him he would ≈øhew her what it was, and the Writings, ≈øhe gave credit to him, thinking his heart had been like his words, gave con≈øent to go along with him, and not onely to ≈øee what he tould her he had there, but al≈øo to ≈øee his Friends, which dwelt there, he being born at <hi>Faul≈øton:</hi> now the time being come that ≈øhe was, according to promi≈øe to go along with him, in order thereunto ≈øhe took Cloaths with her, and al≈øo her ≈øon, having none at home to leave him with, and with what Money ≈øhe had, ≈øhe goes with him, not thinking that her journey had been ≈øo ≈øhort as it proved to be: for they were not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Mile, or their abouts, but he con≈øidered with him≈øelf, what he ≈øhould do in ca≈øe he ≈øhould have her to the place he had told her, it being but a fal≈øe and a meer forged ≈øtory, that he had made to delude her, and being now in abundance of care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Devil that Old Serpent, that lies in wait to devour, quickly laid hold of this Opportunity, and having ≈øtrong hold, and good footing before, intends to bring this his ≈øervant into his own bo≈øome, that had ≈øo long nd faithfully ≈øerved him: tells him that his be≈øt an donely way was, if he could, to get get her to be kind to him before hand: this bait of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils was very plea≈øing to him: he there puts it into practice, and finding a convenient pa≈ø≈øage out of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171920:4"/>Rode-way, into a Copps or Wood, he intreats her to go with him: ≈øhe readily follows him, like a poor innocent Lamb: where being come into a ≈øecret place, he de≈øires one favour of her, and that was, that ≈øince they were both agreed, ≈øhe would be plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let him injoy ≈øome neerer familiarity then had formerly been between them, which ≈øhe re≈øu≈øed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always vertuou≈øly inclined: he finding he could not prevail in this, readily hearkened to what the Devil had before In≈øinuated: Who advi≈øed him to Kill her and her child, and told him that the place was ≈øo fecret that he vvould never be found out, and thereupon he is vvilling to try this unhumane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy: vvhich he acted thus: he finding no vvay to bring his bu≈øine≈øs about to the obreyning his vvill of her, was the more incen≈øed again≈øt her, and there upon Dravvs his Knife, and Cutts her Threat, in ≈øeveral Gha≈øtly formes; and then acts vvor≈øe then a Bea≈øt, takes his vvill of her vvhen ≈øhe could not help her ≈øelf, before ≈øhe vvas quite Dead, as he hath ≈øince re≈øated to the Goal-Keeper of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Landman:</hi> and having performed this unnatural act, he takes vvhat Money ≈øhe had, and ≈øeeks after the little Foy, vvho in this time of their Di≈øcour≈øe, vvas rambled a little vvay off, further into the Copps, not minding vvhat they did: He having found him, cuts his throat, and ≈øo flyes to <hi>Dover,</hi> intending to pa≈øs over to <hi>France;</hi> about ten Days after comes to the Wood a poor boy to gather ≈øticks, and with him was a Dog, and while the boy was bu≈øie a ≈øeeking fireing, the Dog was bu≈øie in
